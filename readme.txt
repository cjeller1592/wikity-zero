==  Wikity Zero ==
Wikity Zero is a tool to bookmark and link ideas. To use Wikity, install the bookmark on your toolbar, select relevant text on a page you are looking at, and give the idea expressed by that text a name. Over time, link that card to other ideas, add additional sources, summaries, or notes.  

You can use to create a personal wiki for notes, bookmarks, photos, or anything else. Unlike traditional bookmarking tools, Wikity lets you connect ideas and share your work with others while maintaining attribution. And because it runs on WordPress your work is always portable -- your site can run anywhere WordPress can (You do need sufficient permissions to upload the theme).

Wikity is particularly useful for classes where students are encouraged to document and connect their learning. Use it as a replacement for the standard learning journal or graded notebook.

Made under the GPL v2.0 or later license. :) Use it to make something cool.
